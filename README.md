## Overview üåê

QueryQuill is software developed on the .NET 8 platform with the goal of simplifying the creation of Google Dorks to enhance browser usage to its full potential.

It can run autonomously in console mode (using pre-built versions) on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms without prerequisites. The GUI version is exclusively available for Windows, utilizing WPF technology, and can also be executed without installation.

You have the option to run and build your own version if you have the .NET 8 SDK installed.

## How to Use üöÄ

## Build üõ†Ô∏è

To build your version, make sure you have the .NET SDK installed.
Use `dotnet publish -c Release` in the WPF or console project folder and specify the target platform with `--runtime`. You can also include the runtime to make your application self-contained with `--self-contained` option. You will find your application in the bin directory of the published project.

For example:

- Publish the application for Windows in 64-bit version without runtime:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release --runtime win-x64
```

- Publish a version for Linux in 32-bit with included runtime:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained --runtime linux-x86
```

| --Runtime {option}| Description         |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| win-x64           | Windows 64-bit      |
| win-x86           | Windows 32-bit      |
| linux-x64         | Linux 64-bit        |
| linux-x86         | Linux 32-bit        |
| linux-arm         | Linux ARM           |
| linux-arm64       | Linux ARM 64-bit    |
| osx-x64           | macOS 64-bit        |
| osx-arm64         | macOS ARM 64-bit    |
| win-arm           | Windows ARM         |
| win-arm64         | Windows ARM 64-bit  |
